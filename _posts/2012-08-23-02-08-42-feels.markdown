## How I Feel About Tests Now
* I __cannot__ live without some form of automated testing.
* Testing consumes a lot of time. Automating testing consumes a lot of time upfront, but pays off in the long run.
* It's hard to write good tests.
* Automated tests are useful until you discover that you're doing it all wrong.
* You must fix your tests as soon as they break.
* Don't stop writing automated tests until you have confidence in your test suite.
* Make sure the tests run in a reasonable amount of time.
