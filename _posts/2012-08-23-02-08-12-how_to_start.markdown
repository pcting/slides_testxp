## How to Start?
* Focus on testing the most important parts of your code
* When you encounter a bug, write a test
* When you're unsure of what happens in a section of code, write a test
* When short on time, work more on end-to-end tests
* When you have plenty of time, work more on unit tests
* When you have free time, write any test
