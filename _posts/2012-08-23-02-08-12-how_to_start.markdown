## How to Start?
* Focus on testing the most important parts of your code.
* When you encounter a bug, write a test for it.
* When you're unsure of what happening in code, write a test to explain it.
* When short on time, work more on end-to-end tests.
* When you have plenty of time, work more on unit tests.
* When you have free time, write any test.
